# Learning F#

In this repository I am collecting basic examples for some libraries, patterns, and other interesting snippets.

The goal is to have an extensive collection of (compiling) code, that covers > 50% of the "How do I do X in F#?" questions.

- [x] Hello World
- [x] Postgres with `Npgsql.FSharp`
    - [x] Could use more advanced examples, like inserts etc.
- [ ] Postgres with `Dapper.FSharp`
- [ ] Firestore
- [ ] Giraffe
    - [x] Hello World
    - [ ] Add and Configure a JSON library
- [x] Suave Hello World
- [ ] Suave [Server-Sent Events (SSE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events)
- [ ] Basic Async
- [x] MailboxProcessor
- [x] Data Viz with `FSharp.Plotly`
- [ ] Compile single-binary executables
- [x] environment variables
- [ ] `FsConfig`


### wishlist:

- [x] `Fsharp.Data`
- [x] `Thoth.Json` decoding pipelines
- [x] `Fsharp.SystemTextJson` (maybe add to Giraffe example)
    - add case convention example
- [ ] Scraping - Extracting data from websites.
