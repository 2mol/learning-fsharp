# Learning F#

In this repository I collect self-contained examples for libraries, patterns, and other interesting snippets.

I want to have an extensive collection of (compiling) code, that covers many of the "How do I do X in F#?" questions.

- [Hello World](hello-world/Program.fs)
- Environment variables

- Basic `Npgsql.FSharp`
- `MailboxProcessor`
- Hello World Suave
- Hello World Giraffe
- `Fsharp.Data`
- `Fsharp.SystemTextJson`
- `Thoth.Json`

## Todo:

- Postgres with `Dapper.FSharp`
- Firestore
- Suave [Server-Sent Events (SSE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events)
- Basic Async
- Data Viz with `FSharp.Plotly`
- Compile single-binary executables
- `FsConfig`
- Scraping - Extracting data from websites.
