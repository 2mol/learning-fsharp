# Learning F#

In this repository I am collecting basic examples for some libraries, patterns, and other interesting snippets.

The goal is to have an extensive collection of (compiling) code, that covers > 50% of the "How do I do X in F#?" questions.

- [x] Hello World
- [x] Postgres with `Npgsql.FSharp`
    - Could use more advanced examples, like inserts etc.
- [ ] Postgres with `Dapper.FSharp`
- [x] Giraffe Hello World
- [ ] Suave Hello World
- [ ] [Server-Sent Events (SSE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server-sent_events) (with Suave)
- [ ] MailboxProcessor
- [ ] Basic Async
- [x] Data Viz with `FSharp.Plotly`
